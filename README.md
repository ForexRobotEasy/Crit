# Crit Forex Indicator

This code is a custom indicator called 'Crit Forex Indicator' developed by the Forex Robot Easy team. The indicator is designed to perform trend analysis and detect potential trend changes in the market. It provides trading instructions and plots arrows on the chart for trade reference.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator is initialized by applying it to the chart and setting the indicator name and number of decimal places to match the instrument being traded.

## Indicator Calculation

The indicator calculates the strength of the trend by analyzing historical data. It calculates the difference between the close prices of each bar and sums them up. The sum is then normalized by dividing it by the total number of bars.

## Trend Change Prediction

Based on the calculated trend strength, the indicator predicts potential changes in the market trend. If the trend strength is less than or equal to zero, it indicates a potential trend change.

## Trading Action Recommendation

The indicator provides a recommended trading action based on the predicted trend change. It randomly selects either 'buying' or 'selling' as the recommended action.

## Arrows on Chart

The indicator plots arrows on the chart to visually indicate the detected trend change. If a trend change is detected, it hides all other chart windows, and if no trend change is detected, it shows all chart windows.
